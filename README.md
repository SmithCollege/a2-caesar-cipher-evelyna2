## Reflection Questions

My favorite part was running the tests, as they confirmed whether my code were written perfectly or not. It gave me a sense of challenge (over and over) and ultimately, fulfillment. And also making my own tests was fun!

The most challenging part was a situation that I had to make new methods, as I wasn't sure if they were supposed to be made, or there were potentially another way of doing it without new method.

General comments on your experience with this assignment: I had a lot of confusion, because I wasn't clear about what I should do or code in this assignment overall. I had to consult with others frequently.

## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?
My favorite part of the assignment was working with Ruby and working through the issues in the code together. I have worked with Ruby in the past and I really enjoy the challenge of talking through code andf sharing our perspectives until we find the correct answer.

What was most challenging about this assignment?
The most challenging part of this assignment was initializing the dynamic array and array list in the CeasarCipher class. I didn't realize at first that the DynamicArray constructor would be so pivotal in the CaesarCipher class because I was thinking of them too separately. Once Ruby and I (with some help from Vivian) realized how we were supposed to set up the alphabet and cipher arrays, the whole assignment felt easier.

General comments on your experience with this assignment: I felt that the instructions weren't very clear, so I spent a lot of time confused and the new Gradle interface/files, added a lot of confusion to the project.
