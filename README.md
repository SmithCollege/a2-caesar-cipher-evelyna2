## Reflection Questions

My favorite part was running the tests, as they confirmed whether my code were written perfectly or not. It gave me a sense of challenge (over and over) and ultimately, fulfillment. And also making my own tests was fun!

The most challenging part was a situation that I had to make new methods, as I wasn't sure if they were supposed to be made, or there were potentially another way of doing it without new method.

General comments on your experience with this assignment: I had a lot of confusion, because I wasn't clear about what I should do or code in this assignment overall. I had to consult with others frequently.
